#Introduction
We present aircraft measurement of BB0A over West Africa.

Particle size was measured using a PCASP (Bloggs et al 2004).

Jones et al (1998) conducted several studies in this region, 
but continental-scale measurements have not previously been made.

#Method
The research was conducted via review of yellow text videos on Youtube.
