# Introduction
We present aircraft measurement of BB0A over West Africa.

Particle size was measured using a PCASP (Bloggs et al 2004).

Jones et al (1998) conducted several studies in this region, 
but continental-scale measurements have not previously been made.

# Methodology
The research was conducted via review of yellow text videos on Youtube. This was compared to
literature published by Smith et al 2002.

# Simulations
Sim was done.

# Results
Results were great.

# Figures
Figures on their own in draft paper.
